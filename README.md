# Python_TCP_chat
This is chat written in python. It uses only asyncio sockets for connections and telnet for chatting.

The 'server.py' file is backend for chat. If you want to run it:

1# At the last line in 'server.py' enter the local IP adress of your pc that will run server \n
2# Open terminal and execute this string "telnet <Server's IP> 8888" \n
3# Chat to everybody on this server. You can open another terminal window and run telnet again to test server. \n

There is also stress test to DDoS this server.

Have fun!
